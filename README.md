We, Game Makers, will be developing "AXEL" 2D tactical RPG in order to entertain our consumers. We will be doing this by providing different playable units, enemy units and battle maps. This will allow for the player to enjoy the game longer as to not get bored of seeing the same exact units on the same map over and over. Units will also have unique stats and skills that further improves the diversity.

The reason for creating the Axel is to provide entertainment. Video games can be seen as a different form of an art medium. Like movies, video games . Video games allow for users to "insert" themselves within the world of the video game, similar to books. Video games are unique as an art medium in that they involve the user more. Unlike books, movies, or tv shows, video games are able to present a story to the user where the user can better insert themselves into the game and subsequently the story because of the way that games can give users the ability to take action as someone in the story.
